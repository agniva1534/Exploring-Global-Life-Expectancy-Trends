# Exploring-Global-Life-Expectancy-Trends

You are a data analyst for a United Nations initiative focused on understanding global health trends. Your latest assignment is to explore and visualize life expectancy data from around the world, focusing on gender differences.

Life expectancy can vary significantly over time and across different countries due to numerous factors, including advancements in medicine, a country's development level, and the impacts of conflicts. Interestingly, data consistently shows that women tend to live longer than men, raising intriguing questions. Could this be due to biological factors or perhaps because women generally care for their health better?
